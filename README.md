This is my attempt at finally learning C++!
This is a CLI game that is supposed to imitate the game Little Alchemy.
Little Alchemy is a Game where you combine different objects to discover new items that will be made.
I do have plans to turn this into a GUI game as i did in python and will do in java, javascript and C#.
I learned alot about different C++ types and how they interact and work with eachother.
The basic concept of creating the CLI game is very similar across languages and thats why I find it so fun to create the same project acrsoo different languages.
I will be using this experience to create more CLI games until i feel comfortable enough to move to creating GUI games.
I used the json header provided by Niels Lohmann [github link --- https://github.com/nlohmann/json].
I have alot of experience using json and this header made is SUPER easy to get data from json.
Niels also made it very similar to other languages when it comes to indexing information using bracket notation!.
Please check out his github the dude is a mad legend imo.
I have to fins a way to get my current work directory path and someone from 2009 provided this greate example on
stack overflow [link --- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/875249/how-to-get-current-directory]. it was edited recently (2001) by
Jimmy T [stack overflow link --- https://stackoverflow.com/users/1659790/jimmy-t]. Big Big shout out to these 2 madlads. They made my job 
super easy and i learned quite a bit about how to navigate files in C++ as well as learning quite a bit about strings too!
Thanks for checking out my project and feel free to check out more on my github --- https://github.com/Marcusgb710
